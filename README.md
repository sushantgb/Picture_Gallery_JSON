# Picture_Gallery_JSON
A picture gallery prepared by using JSON, AJAX and JS

It is a simple photo gallery but it uses XHR (AJAX) to get the data from a JSON file.
And displays one image at time.
Images can be navigated in either direction by the navigation button.
The buttons navigate gallery in cycling way, i.e. there is no stop point for buttons.
If you reach the last image, if you click the next button you'll be taken to the first image.
Similary happens when you are on the first image by back button.
